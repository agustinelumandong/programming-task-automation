# Quick Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Update Email Addresses

**CRITICAL**: You must update the email addresses in these files:

1. **`.github/workflows/email-automation.yml`** - Line 33:
   ```yaml
   to: your-actual-email@gmail.com  # Change this!
   ```

2. **`.github/workflows/failure-notification.yml`** - Line 29:
   ```yaml
   to: your-actual-email@gmail.com  # Change this!
   ```

3. **`.github/workflows/weekly-report.yml`** - Line 46:
   ```yaml
   to: your-actual-email@gmail.com  # Change this!
   ```

4. **`.github/scripts/send-email.mjs`** - Line 19:
   ```javascript
   to: 'your-actual-email@gmail.com', // Change this!
   ```

### 2. Create Gmail App Password

1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable **2-Factor Authentication** if not already enabled
3. Go to **App passwords**
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. **Copy the 16-character password** (you won't see it again!)

### 3. Configure GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret** and add:
   - **Name**: `EMAIL_USERNAME`, **Value**: Your Gmail address
   - **Name**: `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, **Value**: The 16-character app password
   - **Name**: `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, **Value**: Same as EMAIL_PASSWORD

### 4. Test the Setup

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Select "Email Automation" workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** â†’ **Run workflow**

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues

**No email received?**
