# GitHub Copilot Programming Challenge Integration

This system creates an automated programming knowledge tester using GitHub Copilot's coding agent integrated with email notifications.

## üéØ How It Works

### Method 1: GitHub Copilot Coding Agent (Implemented)

The system uses **GitHub Copilot's official coding agent** which runs in its own GitHub Actions environment to solve programming challenges autonomously.

#### Process Flow:
1. **Challenge Creation** ‚Üí Automated workflows create programming problems as GitHub issues
2. **Copilot Assignment** ‚Üí Issues are automatically assigned to `@copilot`
3. **Solution Development** ‚Üí Copilot analyzes, codes, and tests solutions in its GitHub Actions environment
4. **Pull Request** ‚Üí Copilot creates PRs with complete implementations
5. **Email Notifications** ‚Üí You receive email alerts at each step
6. **Review & Merge** ‚Üí You review and approve the solutions

## üìß Email Notification System

You'll receive emails for:
- **Daily Challenge Creation** (8 AM UTC, weekdays)
- **Copilot Solution Ready** (when PR is created)
- **Solution Merged** (when PR is approved and merged)
- **Weekly Progress Reports** (Mondays)

## üöÄ Available Workflows

### 1. Daily Programming Challenge (`daily-programming-challenge.yml`)
- **Schedule**: Weekdays at 8 AM UTC
- **Manual Trigger**: Choose challenge sets (basic/intermediate/advanced/all)
- **Creates**: Multiple programming problems with varying difficulty

### 2. Copilot Programming Challenge (`copilot-programming-challenge.yml`)
- **Schedule**: Daily at 10 AM UTC
- **Manual Trigger**: Specify problem number and difficulty
- **Creates**: Individual programming challenges

### 3. Copilot Solution Monitor (`copilot-solution-monitor.yml`)
- **Triggers**: On PR events, issue updates
- **Monitors**: Copilot's progress and solution delivery
- **Notifies**: Email alerts for solution status

## üé≤ Available Programming Challenges

### Basic Set (Default)
**Problem #3: Find Students with Highest Grades**
```javascript
students = [
  { name: 'marvin', grade: 89 },
  { name: 'kenth', grade: 85 },
  { name: 'jeff', grade: 95 },
];
```
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Topics**: Array manipulation, Object access, Maximum values

**Problem #4: Count Students Who Passed**
```javascript
grades = [85, 42, 78, 91, 55, 73, 88, 39, 67, 94];
```
- **Difficulty**: Easy  
- **Topics**: Array filtering, Conditional logic, Counting

### Intermediate Set
**Problem #5: Calculate Grade Statistics**
- **Topics**: Statistical calculations, Array sorting, Frequency analysis
- **Includes**: Average, Median, Mode, Grade distribution

### Advanced Set
**Problem #6: Optimize Student Grouping**
- **Topics**: Algorithm optimization, Load balancing, Combinatorial problems
- **Challenge**: Create balanced teams with similar grade averages

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

## üïê Timeline Expectations

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Issue Creation** | Instant | GitHub workflow creates and assigns issue to Copilot |
| **Analysis** | 5-10 minutes | Copilot analyzes requirements and plans solution |
| **Implementation** | 15-30 minutes | Copilot writes, tests, and refines code |
| **Documentation** | 5-10 minutes | Copilot adds comments and documentation |
| **PR Creation** | Instant | Pull request is created and you get email notification |

**Total Time**: ~25-50 minutes per challenge
